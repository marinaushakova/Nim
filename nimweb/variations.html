				<h2>Game variations</h2>
     			
     			<p>Nim has variuos versions. While the main concept of the game stays the same 
     				details and configurations of Nim's versions a different.
     			</p>
     			<p>
     				Here are some exapmles of Nim variations.
     			</p>
     			
     			<dl>
			        <dt><strong>General game</strong></dt>
					    <dd>The normal game is between two players and played with three heaps of any number of objects. 
					    	The two players alternate taking any number of objects from any single one of the heaps. 
					    	The goal is to be the last to take an object. In misere play, the goal is instead to ensure 
					    	that the opponent is forced to take the last remaining object.
					    </dd>
					<dt><strong>The Subtraction Game S (1,2,...,k)</strong></dt>	  
					    <dd> In another game which is commonly known as Nim (but is better called the subtraction game S (1,2,...,k)), 
					    	an upper bound is imposed on the number of objects that can be removed in a turn. 
					    	Instead of removing arbitrarily many objects, a player can only remove 1 or 2 or ... or k at a time. 
					    	This game is commonly played in practice with only one heap.
					    </dd>
				    <dt><strong>The 21 game</strong></dt>	  
					    <dd>The game "21" is played as a misere game with any number of players who take turns 
					    	saying a number. The first player says "1" and each player in turn increases the number 
					    	by 1, 2, or 3, but may not exceed 21; the player forced to say "21" loses.
					    	The 21 game can also be played with different numbers, like "Add at most 5; lose on 34".
					    </dd> 
				    <dt><strong>A multiple-heap rule</strong></dt>	  
					    <dd>In another variation of Nim, besides removing any number of objects from a single heap, 
					    	one is permitted to remove the same number of objects from each heap.
					    </dd>
					<dt><strong>Curcular Nim</strong></dt>	  
					    <dd>Yet another variation of Nim is 'Circular Nim', where any number of objects are placed 
					    	in a circle, and two players alternately remove one, two or three adjacent objects.
					    </dd>
					<dt><strong>Grundy's game</strong></dt>	  
					    <dd>In Grundy's game, another variation of Nim, a number of objects are placed in an initial heap, 
					    	and two players alternately divide a heap into two nonempty heaps of different sizes. 
					    	Thus, six objects may be divided into piles of 5+1 or 4+2, but not 3+3. 
					    	Grundy's game can be played as either misere or normal play.
					    </dd>
					<dt><strong>Greedy Nim</strong></dt>	  
					    <dd> Greedy Nim is a variation where the players are restricted to choosing stones 
					    	from only the largest pile(s).
					    </dd>
