				<h2>General rules of the Game of Nim</h2>
     			<p>Nim is played starting with piles or rows of objects. 
     				Players take turns taking any number of objects from one of the piles.
     			</p>
     			<p>
     				Nim can be played as a misere game, in which the player to take the last object loses. 
     				Nim can also be played as a normal play game, which means that the person who makes 
     				the last move (i.e., who takes the last object) wins. This is called normal play 
     				because most games follow this convention, even though Nim usually does not.
